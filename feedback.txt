Pros:
Simple and Clean Code: The code is straightforward and easy to understand, which is great for maintainability and further development.

Basic Functionalities Covered: It includes essential features like adding team members, scheduling meetings, and sending reminders.

Readability: The use of comments and clear function names enhances the readability of the code.

Cons/Suggestions for Improvement:
Data Persistence: Currently, the data (team members and meetings) is stored in memory and will be lost when the script terminates. Implementing data persistence using a database or even a simple file-based system would be a significant improvement.

Error Handling: The code lacks error handling. Adding checks, for example, to verify if a team member exists before scheduling them for a meeting, would make the bot more robust.

User Interface: The script operates in a command-line environment. A user interface, even a simple CLI menu or integration with a messaging platform, would enhance user experience.

Time Zone Management: In global teams, managing time zones is crucial. Incorporating time zone support for each team member would be a valuable feature.

Duplication in Meeting Scheduling: The current implementation allows the same participant to be added multiple times to the same meeting. Implementing a check to prevent this would be more practical.

Automated Reminders: Currently, reminders need to be manually triggered. Automating this process, perhaps with a scheduler, would be more in line with the bot's purpose.

Testing and Documentation: Adding unit tests and comprehensive documentation would make the bot more reliable and user-friendly.

Overall, the Stand-Up Bot serves as a good foundation. With further development, particularly in areas of user interaction, error handling, and data management, it could be a very useful tool for team coordination.
